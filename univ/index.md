## University

In University, I'm trying new things.

### Cancellation Information Acquisition Program (Python)<a class="zip_download_link" href="https://github.com/7vXXi/portfolio/raw/master/univ/Notify.zip">Download this project as a .zip file</a>

In my university, when a lecture is canceled, a notice will be posted on the campus site.
Get that information and notify LINE. And, information that has already been acquired is not notified.
