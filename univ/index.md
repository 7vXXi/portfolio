## University

In University, I'm trying new things.

### Shooting Game (HTML + JavaScript)
<a class="zip_download_link" href="https://github.com/7vXXi/portfolio/raw/master/univ/shooting.zip">Download this project as a .zip file</a>

It is a shooting game created in the class.
You will be able to play [here](https://7vxxi.github.io/portfolio/univ/shoot/)

### Cancellation Information Acquisition Program (Python)<a class="zip_download_link" href="https://github.com/7vXXi/portfolio/raw/master/univ/otify.zip">Download this project as a .zip file</a>

In my university, when a lecture is canceled, a notice will be posted on the campus site.
Get that information and notify LINE. And, information that has already been acquired is not notified.
