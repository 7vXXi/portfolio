### About me

Nice to meet you. My name is Yuuki, a 20-year-old attending Tokyo University of Technology. When I was in third grade, I started programming with an interest in creating games on my own.

This site is a portfolio site where I wrote what I have done.I want many people to know me. 

## Achievement　

### Junior High School

#### Quiz Game

I learned how to make a quiz game on a site for super beginners. The language used is Java. This was my first programming.

Here, I write an input process that was particularly interesting.

```
try {	 
    final int IMPUT_MAX = 3; //Max Value
    //Keyboard reading process
    java.util.Scanner sc = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);	 
    int inputInt = sc.nextInt();	 
    //Check and subsititution
    if (inputInt > 0 && inputInt <= IMPUT_MAX) {	 
        tmpInputNum = inputInt;	 
    } else {	 
        System.out.println("Over limit!");	 
    }	 
} catch (Exception e) {	 
    System.out.println("Please enter only numbers!");	 
}
```
