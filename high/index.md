## High School

In high school, I began to learn from assembly language, and I learned C, C ++, and Java languages.

I made a shopping site as one of the lesson subjects. 
Here, we will fix the code and publish the data uploaded to the rental server.

What is the tower of Hanoi?
>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi

![Tower of Hanoi Image](/portfolio/images/hanoi.gif)

Please specify the number on the command line.

```
void Hanoi(int n, char from, char work, char to)
{
  if (n > 0) {
    Hanoi(n-1, from, to, work);
    // Output from → to
    Hanoi(n-1, work, from, to);
  }
  return;
}
```
Here is the function I implemented.
From the Tower of Hanoi, I learned many things such as basic syntax, sorting, arrays, 
string operations, search methods, recursion, file operations, links, and more.

### Android Java Program



### Group programming
